üîç A sophisticated fact-checking platform that uses AI to verify statements through multi-agent collaboration, powered by Large Language Models.

## üåü Overview

Foxcheck is an asynchronous application built with FastAPI that validates and verifies statements using a multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The platform employs a sophisticated orchestration of agents that search multiple sources (Wikipedia, arXiv, web) to gather evidence, analyze the information, and render verdicts on statement accuracy.

The system is designed for journalists, researchers, and anyone seeking to verify factual claims with a rigorous, evidence-based approach. Foxcheck not only provides verdicts (True, Mostly True, Uncertain, Mostly False, False) but also delivers comprehensive explanations with references to support its conclusions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **ü§ñ Multi-Agent Fact-Checking**: Employs a collaborative system of specialized agents that work together to verify statements:
  - Supervisor Agent: Coordinates the fact-checking process
  - Research Agents: Search Wikipedia, arXiv, and the web for relevant information
  - Adjudicator: Analyzes gathered evidence and renders a verdict
  - Reviewer: Ensures the verdict meets quality standards

- **üîç Statement Verification**: Provides nuanced verdicts (True, Mostly True, Uncertain, Mostly False, False) with detailed explanations and references.

- **üìä LLM Orchestration**: Uses LangChain and LangGraph for sophisticated workflows that enable multi-hop reasoning and iterative research.

- **üìà Live Tracing and Monitoring**: Integrates LangSmith for real-time tracing and monitoring of LLM performance.

- **üß™ Experimentation and Evaluation**: Supports building datasets, defining metrics, and conducting experiments to evaluate and improve fact-checking accuracy.

- **üîê User Authentication**: Provides secure user registration and login using JWT tokens.

- **üåê Chrome Extension**: Browser extension that extracts article content from news sites (NYT, Substack) for fact-checking.

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Statement Input**: Users submit statements for verification through the API or Chrome extension.

2. **Multi-Agent Processing**:
   - The Supervisor Agent analyzes the statement and determines what information is needed
   - Research Agents search multiple sources (Wikipedia, arXiv, web) to gather relevant evidence
   - The system may perform multiple research iterations (multi-hop) to find more specific information
   - The Adjudicator analyzes all gathered evidence and renders a verdict with explanation
   - The Reviewer ensures the verdict is well-supported and may request additional research if needed

3. **Verdict Delivery**: The system returns a final verdict with:
   - Accuracy rating (True, Mostly True, Uncertain, Mostly False, False)
   - Detailed explanation of the reasoning
   - References to support the conclusion

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Docker** (optional for containerization)
- **Nix** (for managing dependencies, if desired)
- **API Keys** for OpenAI, Tavily, and LangSmith

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ledgerW/foxcheck.git
   cd foxcheck
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

   ```
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./foxcheck.db
   
   # Authentication
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ALGORITHM=HS256
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
   
   # API Keys
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
   
   # LangSmith (for tracing)
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
   LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=foxcheck
   LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload

   Build and run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker build -t foxcheck .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 foxcheck
   ```
