# Foxcheck

Foxcheck is an asynchronous application built with FastAPI, designed to validate and verify statements using Large Language Models (LLMs). Leveraging LangChain for LLM orchestration and LangSmith for monitoring and evaluation, Foxcheck offers a robust platform for statement verification tasks.

## Features

- **Statement Verification**: Utilizes LLMs to assess the validity of given statements.
- **LLM Orchestration**: Employs LangChain to manage and streamline interactions with LLMs.
- **Live Tracing and Monitoring**: Integrates LangSmith for real-time tracing and monitoring of LLM performance.
- **Experimentation and Evaluation**: Uses LangSmith to build datasets, define metrics, and conduct experiments for evaluating LLM efficacy in statement verification.
- **User Authentication**: Provides secure user registration and login using JWT tokens.
- **Chrome Extension**: Offers a browser extension for seamless interaction with the application.

## Technologies and Tools

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **SQLModel**: ORM for handling database operations.
- **LangChain**: Framework for developing applications powered by LLMs.
- **LangSmith**: Platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring LLM applications.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization.
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**: For the Chrome extension and front-end components.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- **`chainlit/`**: Integrations for visualizing experimental chains.
- **`chains/`**: Contains the LangChain chains responsible for LLM orchestration.
- **`chrome_extension/`**: Code for the Chrome extension.
- **`dspy/`**: Data processing scripts and utilities.
- **`evaluation/`**: Scripts and methods for evaluating experiments using LangSmith.
- **`experiments/`**: Configurations and scripts for running experiments.
- **`routers/`**: API route definitions.
- **`static/`** and **`templates/`**: Front-end assets for the API documentation and other web pages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Docker** (optional for containerization)
- **Nix** (for managing dependencies, if desired)
- **FastAPI** and other dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ledgerW/foxcheck.git
   cd foxcheck
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and define the necessary environment variables, such as `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, and others for JWT and database configuration.

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   This will start the FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

5. **Access API Documentation**

   Open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to explore the API documentation generated by FastAPI.

6. **Optional: Using Docker**

   Build and run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker build -t foxcheck .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 foxcheck
   ```

7. **Using the Chrome Extension**

   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser.
   - Enable "Developer mode" and load the unpacked extension from the `chrome_extension` directory.
